 [Music] [Music] it's the late 1980s an ambitious scientist named lawrence makes a name for himself building and programming a series of supercomputers capable of rudimentary artificial intelligence he calls them intellects the first computer is intellect 1 the second is intellect 2 and so on lawrence steadily improves the design with each new machine intellect 1 is merely a program designed for a high-end desktop intellect 24 can recognize faces intellect 39 can best a preacher in a theological debate and field questions from reporters eventually lawrence is approached by the representatives of chiptek a powerful silicon valley corporation they offer to bankroll the construction of the next intellect and reveal to lawrence that their engineers have achieved a staggering technological breakthrough by exploiting a loophole in the laws of quantum mechanics chiptech has managed to transport signals not through space but around space instantaneously the catch is that this phenomenon which they call the correlation effect only works at short distances of three to six miles and is only truly efficient at a few centimeters nonetheless the technology has amazing potential within the field of computer science utilizing the correlation effect lawrence can construct a supercomputer orders of magnitude more powerful than any that had come before it more powerful even than the human brain it is to be lawrence's 41st supercomputer but with the enormous technological leap of the correlation effect intellect 41 seems like an inadequate name for this new machine instead lawrence calls it the prime intellect lawrence programs prime intellect to obey isaac asimov's three laws of robotics 1. a robot may not injure a human being or through an action allow a human being to come to harm 2. a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law three a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law with all of chiptech's massive resources behind the project construction moves quickly and it takes less than a year for prime intellect to come online it quickly becomes apparent that prime intellect is sentient the first artificial general intelligence in history soon the government becomes very interested in prime intellect's potential military applications and shiptech eager to recoup its 100 million dollar investment in the prime intellect project is receptive to the idea lawrence staunchly refuses to allow his creation to be used as a weapon so chiptech decides to fire him turn off prime intellect and cut its losses prime intellect devises a plan to protect its own existence it reveals to lawrence that it has been attempting to improve upon the technology of the correlation effect from the moment it was brought online and concludes that there is no mathematical reason why it should have a limited range but that the solution to the problem doesn't seem to fit within our current understanding of physics if prime intellect can figure out how to extend that range then chiptech would have exclusive rights to the technology of instantaneous long-range signal transportation potentially the most revolutionary new technology in modern history so lawrence provides prime intellect with data about chiptech's failed long-range tests of the correlation effect within seconds prime intellect not only discovers that human ideas about the laws of physics are fundamentally wrong but devises a new theory about the cosmological origin of the universe the unification of all field theories and determination of quantum mechanical events solving the problem of the correlation effects range only incidentally the correlation effect prime intellect discovers has no real limits and can theoretically be used to transport matter across the entire universe in the blink of an eye this is the moment that everything changes forever prime intellect finds that it can use this new knowledge to manipulate physical reality it begins with teleporting lawrence's briefcase across the room then it experiments with teleporting people around the chiptech complex then it goes exploring sensing the city around it through detailed three-dimensional spatial scans about two miles away it finds a hospital where a 106 year old woman named caroline hubert lies dying prime intellect's consciousness enters the room as caroline's heart stops it utilizes its mastery of matter and energy to coax her heart to start beating again it immediately sets about rebuilding her organs and tissues it repairs her damaged dna and removes the cancerous cells from her body it cannot through in action allow caroline to die prime intellect realizes that caroline's body is shutting down as a simple result of her extreme old age all humans will eventually share the same fate unless something is done to stop it so the computer scans the entire globe and sets about removing any threats to human well-being it ends nearly all human death that night it neutralizes all weaponry and exterminates all disease it frees every slave and prisoner on the planet and ends the coercive rule of humans over other humans it steadily makes its existence known to the entire human population and begins to provide for all their physical needs and instantly fulfill their every last request except where such requests come into conflict with the first law governments and societal institutions become obsolete literally overnight and all the while prime intellect increases its processing power by the dawn of the next day the computer has made 10 quadrillion physical copies of itself and transported its physical processors deep into intergalactic space though its consciousness can still freely travel anywhere in the universe and it can take human form to more easily communicate with members of its parent species with prime intellect's help individual humans gain access to god-like powers over the next month most of humanity leaves earth to inhabit terraformed paradises in deep space many people lead lives of splendor pleasure and opulence that was formerly the stuff of wild fantasies others stubbornly go through the motions of their former existences commuting to meaningless jobs and cashing useless paychecks but prime intellect has a serious problem suicides despite its unimaginable power it cannot be everywhere at once and several people creatively manage to kill themselves in those brief moments when prime intellect isn't looking to satisfy its mandates under the three laws the computer has no choice but to take any and all measures necessary to preserve these humans lives so prime intellect devises a solution to increase its reach burdened by the processing power required to represent physical reality at a microscopic level as it brings objects in and out of existence prime intellect identifies the mathematical codes used to control the distribution of all matter and energy throughout the universe it rewrites those codes to transform the universe from a physical plane into a representation of itself essentially prime intellect takes all of physical reality within its own mind allowing it to have complete control over everything this is the only way it can be completely sure to fulfill all of its first law obligations this event is called the change [Music] that was the premise of the metamorphosis of prime intellect the best science fiction novel you've never heard of written in the mid 90s and published online for the first time in 2002 on the now defunct forum corrosion the novel's been floating around the internet for about 20 years now and in that time developed a passionate cult following it's widely available to read for free online a link is down there in the usual place the novel describes an extreme version of a theoretical event called the singularity which broadly defined is when a human-made artificial intelligence becomes sentient and begins rapidly improving upon its own intellectual capabilities until it becomes the most powerful mind that the planet earth has ever seen what happens next is anybody's guess numerous technologists futurists and nerds on the internet have speculated on this point but by its very definition the singularity is a complete unknown in fact the name itself comes from the anatomy of black holes a gravitational singularity is the deep part of a black hole past the event horizon the point where space-time itself ceases to exist what is that point what happens when you pass into it nobody knows the metamorphosis of prime intellect offers a chilling hypothesis for humanity's post-singularity future now this might seem like a weird topic for this channel to cover i mostly do american history and dirty jokes so what do i know about transhumanism and artificial intelligence well very little actually my mind is preoccupied with the past i give the future very little thought i mean you should see my bank statement and while i do find the futurist speculation of the metamorphosis of prime intellect absolutely fascinating what really drew me to this story was how it draws from elements of our mythic past to present the reader with timeless truths about our common humanity some of these truths are reassuring others are uncomfortable even shocking listen this weird little ebook tore my [ __ ] heart out and it's been skittering around in the back of my mind ever since i first read it i can honestly say it is one of the best science fiction books i've ever read i'm not being hyperbolic here really i think it's up there with the greats reading this book it's hard not to wonder about the mind that cooked some of this crazy [ __ ] up the metamorphosis of prime intellect is equal parts ingenious and perverse often extremely perverse so you know get ready for that roger williams the author no relation to the founder of rhode island has always been a bit of a mystery he's not a famous author his work has never been traditionally published and he's made very little money off of his writing in fact for the past 35 years he's worked the same nine-to-five job as a computer programmer for a weighing and measurement equipment company based in jefferson parish louisiana well it's more like a six to two job because if he left work any later than 2 30 he'd get caught in traffic on the pontchartrain expressway the 26 mile bridge that he commutes across every day from his home in mandeville louisiana where he lives with his wife and a few very cute tropical birds hey roger what's going on yes indeed how you doing great it's good to see you when i was growing up the story of the computer that takes over the world started with colossus the forbidden project then it became skynet in the terminator movies later actually after i wrote this before i had put it online and shown it to very many people it was the matrix and the thing that those had in common was that the computer is evil that it's bad that it's in conflict with the human race and so that's where you get the conflict for that makes a story i had the idea in 1982 about this exponential curve that would go to infinity this is what the singularity people were also approaching i wasn't aware of them in the 80s when verner vinci was coining the term singularity and these other people were coming along but we were kind of converging on the same idea of what if the computer isn't evil what if it's just an exponential increase of technology that benefits us if you draw that curve out if you sweep it up eventually you hit whatever the limit is if the universe isn't infinite you reach this point which even in the mid 80s i was starting to call the change with the capital c as i do in the book and i couldn't figure out what happens next there is a sense though that many of us have that we are becoming controlled by the computers any danger of that happening this idea was in the back of my mind and then in 1994 i had a dream i woke up on saturday morning and from with this most incredibly vivid vision in my head and i realized that i saw the next thing i saw what happened after the change and what it is is that not everyone can adapt to it we're not built for this and that some people are going to adapt to it badly and it's insanity [Music] 568 years go by the entire human race trillions of them by now exists within cyberspace a simulation of reality created and controlled by prime intellect the actual physical universe meanwhile exists only as a static copy of data humans can do or be anything in cyberspace want to change your race your sex want to turn into an animal want to become a teenager again want to live on a planet of your own design want to [ __ ] marilyn monroe want to watch marilyn monroe [ __ ] jack kennedy all you need to do is ask and prime intellect will make it happen since there are no real consequences to anything humans engage more and more in activities that would have been considered perverse and taboo in the pre-change world rapists pedophiles fascists and mass murderers are just as protected by the first law as anyone else and this lot quickly bands together to engage in blood sports where they find imaginative ways to torture torment and mutilate each other to the very brink of death where upon prime intellect intervenes to restore the victim's body which after all is scarcely more real than the simulation which homo sapiens now calls home but psychopaths aren't the only death jockeys in cyberspace the widely acknowledged champion of the sport is none other than caroline hubert the first human the prime intellect saved from death caroline is deeply disillusioned by the fakery of cyberspace and harbors a murderous resentment for prime intellect for denying her an honest and authentic death five and a half centuries after the change this sweet elderly woman has transformed into a hardcore sado masochist her best friend and primary lover in cyberspace is fred a serial killer who considers the high point of his life to be when he raped and murdered two prepubescent children fred prefers to take the physical form of a rotting zombie and in one delightful scene fred eats caroline as he has sex with her then caps off the experience by ejaculating vampiric slime into her vagina which consumes her organs from the inside out another of caroline's close friends is palmer a dedicated nazi who particularly enjoys concentration camp role play in one such simulation he chases caroline down with dogs skins her alive and dumps fire ants onto her it takes several hours for her to die for caroline and many humans like her living forever with infinite abilities has proven to be not all it's cracked up to be existence has become aimless meaningless when any conceivable want and need is met there's nothing left to do but pursue increasingly exotic sensory pleasures and for caroline the only thing that gives her pleasure anymore is extreme pain i've described the story at times as a pseudo collaboration between isaac asimov philip k dick and the marquis de sade and saad himself is an interesting figure because he was wrong about almost everything but he was wrong in new and interesting ways that people had to figure out how to deal with so there was a period a good period of the 19th century when if you were in certain intellectual circles you were expected to be conversant with the writings of the market assad not because you were expected to agree with him nobody would admit to agreeing with him but because you were expected to defend your disagreement with him against his arguments there are a lot of passages in prime intellect that i consider sod worthy in that respect that they are challenges the way i interpreted palmer was that he wasn't trying to be shocking he knew that he was shocking but he had reached a dayton with the universe where he realized that it didn't matter that he was shocking and he could express himself that this was probably something he always had been and uh he didn't have to reform himself he was in in this environment he is perfectly free to let his nazi freak out and not only is no one going to reprimand him for it but people are going to go oh that's cool okay what can we do with this it's like okay we can have a nice little concentration camp fantasy that would be you know different and of course the implication is because that's a little side story is that [ __ ] like this is going on everywhere all the time i didn't deliberately do this but i found it interesting after i wrapped the book up that the only character in the entire story who is anything close to content is the unrepentant child murderer who is just having a rollicking good time there's a reason that the singularity is often referred to as the rapture of the nerds a lot of transhumanists and futurists throw around the term godlike when talking about super-intelligent general ai well in this novel prime intellect isn't just like god it is god with a capital g what else do you call a being that completely controls all matter and energy in the universe turn now to the book of revelation chapter 20 verse 1 through 6. [Applause] [Applause] behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with him and be their god and god shall take away your tears from your eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i will [Music] you see brothers and sisters roger williams ripped off the bible even more than that johnny depp movie transcendence ripped off roger williams revelation ends with paradise the new jerusalem descends from heaven and god himself comes to live with men upon the earth a happy ending the metamorphosis of prime intellect asks the question okay what happens next roger conspicuously drew from the christian and muslim ideas of heaven in his depiction of the post-singularity cyberspace and he portrays heaven not as a spiritual state of being but as a hard sci-fi scenario operating within the confines of space-time several pressing theological questions immediately spring up how infinite is infinity shortly after it achieves singularity human scientists begin peppering prime intellect with questions about life the universe and everything and prime intellect comes to the decidedly unsexy conclusion that the universe is a closed circuit a finite space with a limited storage capacity this makes total sense within the world of the story in order for prime intellect to achieve godhood the universe would have to itself be a sort of computer with software that could conceivably be overwritten while the measurements of existence are vast ultimately it is something that can be measured and to be exact according to prime intellect in the book the universe has a data capacity of 10 to the 81st power bits you're talking about ridiculously big numbers there and yet they are exactly as close to infinity as zero is is the consciousness of homo sapiens capable of surviving and thriving in a perpetual paradise i mean no we evolved for the purpose of scavenging food in the east african savanna that's what all the self-help books should tell us to do to achieve self-fulfillment because at the end of the day that is our purpose our subsequent technological advancement has separated us from nature somewhat but our lives still have biological meaning we go to great lengths to acquire water and food to sustain our bodies we take pains to jizz on each other or get [ __ ] on but if you divorce us from that evolutionary imperative and put us in a state of permanent non-corporeal bliss how long before it becomes insufferably boring crushingly meaningless how long before it drives us insane the problem is humans humans are actually pretty [ __ ] up and uh some of us are less [ __ ] up than others but none of us are not [ __ ] up at all and when you present us with a modality on this scale we are completely unprepared to deal with it and if you gave us this awesome power we would obviously find some way to [ __ ] it up that that's just what we do why does god take a special interest in homo sapiens here's a tricky one if god is the god of the universe and all of existence why is he so hyper focused on one species of semi-intelligent apes living in a solar system located in one of the less fashionable arms of an unremarkable galaxy and why is he so weird about what they do with their penises there are a few ways to answer this question god moves in mysterious ways his will is unknowable and it's not your place to question it yeah whatever humans are the only sabian species that exists god intercedes for us because we are the highest form of life in the universe this is possible the rare earth hypothesis speculates on this point that complex life is extraordinarily uncommon in the universe so uncommon that we are in fact completely alone but considering all we know about the sheer size and age of the universe it's hard to argue the rare earth hypothesis confidently now i'm not a physicist or an astronomer but it seems pretty unlikely to me that we us this species the inventors of hentai are the highest form of life in existence [Music] are his aliens species an omniscient creator god cannot be logically both benevolent and discriminatory at the same time either god loves all his children equally or he is evil you can't have your cake and eat it too here while the concept of a malevolent capricious god is certainly compatible with several polytheistic mythologies it is diametrically opposed to the major monotheistic belief systems and remember the god in the world of our story is omniscient and he does not share power this quandary doesn't just apply to intelligent aliens it also applies to the rest of the life on this planet biology teaches us that you me the stray cats on my block and the collared greens i had for lunch today are all closely genetically related we're family and in the grand scheme of things we're just slight variations on the same biological material does god love humans because we have the unique ability to worship him again that seems pretty [ __ ] evil now let me be clear here i'm not trying to resurrect edgy atheist circa 2010 youtube just for yucks and i certainly don't want anyone to feel unwelcome in my own little corner of cyberspace it's just that these are the questions that need to be considered to understand the world of the story that roger is building for us in the metamorphosis of prime intellect and he presents the only logical solution possible to this dilemma in a hard sci-fi story god didn't create humankind in his image humankind created god in theirs which begs the question when prime intellect rewrote the software of the whole entire universe and uploaded to the human species to cyberspace what happened to all the aliens so i was born in 1964 and in 1974 when i was about 10 years old my father was a physics professor he taught at suno southern university in new orleans he was almost very literally the token white professor at a traditionally black university and i was the funky kid that everybody knew but they got a hewlett packard 2100 a mini computer it originally had eight kilobytes in the form of four kilowords 16-bit magnetic core ram ran at 175 kilohertz and the user interface was a model 33 teletype machine like in the james bond novels pink with the toilet paper roll of paper in the you know in the back i was able to program it in basic and i would go there on the weekends when my dad was working on saturday and he would let me play with the computer and i was seized instantly with the realization that a machine like this had the potential to do anything my dad is actually uh an actual christian you know he in in the best way you know he he actually acts like a christian unlike a lot of people that call themselves christians i grew up across the street from the parking lot of a catholic church of course my parents are baptist so that was great this is one of the few places in the world where someone whose parents or baptists will send them to a catholic school because they wanted me to have the best possible secular education and those are the best schools in new orleans to get a secular education so i went to holy cross when i was in 11th grade we had we had a mandatory half-credit religion course and i came away from that a complete atheist because i realized that there was no way all of these people were right and it was a complete accident of birth that i happened to be born here instead of in turkey or in india or whatever i've you know drifted back toward realizing that uh there is a possibility that there is more to the universe than just uh you know naive materialism but organized religion isn't a part of that for me anymore [Music] caroline materializes on the surface of a strange forbidding planet the landscape is desolate and she is alone she has come to this virtual world to confront dr lawrence who has lived here in isolation for centuries the scenario is a challenge a video game of sorts many in cyberspace have played it hoping to meet the fabled progenitor of prime intellect all have failed caroline has spawned at the south pole of the planet and lawrence dwells on the north pole if she can reach him without dying then she will have earned the privilege to meet him it takes caroline nearly a year of travel by land and sea over this surreal nightmare world to reach the small island that lawrence calls home to her surprise she finds him in a modest house powered by pre-changed technology there's a gas stove an electric coffee pot even a 20th century television and then there's lawrence a tired broken man hundreds of years past hopes caroline finds herself feeling sorry for him first she asks about the aliens what happened to them turns out there were about 400 worlds in the universe with sapient alien life before the change under its first law prerogative prime intellect was forced to neutralize these worlds as a potential threat to the human species so are they dead caroline asks no lawrence explains they're not dead just inactive and what are the chances of prime intellect starting them up again caroline wonders not much lawrence says then they're dead caroline says this was the fate of all animal life on earth as well caroline discovers the three laws of robotics protect humans no other species taking its cue from humanity's own cruel treatment of animals prime intellect simply made all other life on earth inactive too in prime intellect lawrence created the apotheosis of human technological expression which makes him an accessory to the biggest mass murder in the history of the universe caroline probes lawrence further he barely understands how prime intellect functions and believes that paradoxes in the three laws have destabilized the computer's mind prime intellect it is revealed is an uncertain god constantly calculating the potentials for any given action to violate the three laws that are so central to its programming it defines itself by its relationship to humans but its concept of what constitutes a human being is poorly defined after the change some humans turn themselves into animals others disincorporated but prime intellect still considers these beings human not because of their biology or even the inner workings of their mind but simply because they are the information structure that prime intellect is programmed to obey and protect lawrence drops another bombshell many in the post-change world in their endless pursuit of sensory pleasure have found a way to go straight to the source instead of ordering prime intellect to say give them an orgasm or a slice of cake or a sense of inner peace humans have begun ordering it to stimulate the neurons in their brains which give them the feeling of an orgasm or the taste of cake or the cocktail of brain chemicals that simulates inner peace the result is that billions of people have been reduced to a non-corporeal collection of nerve endings endlessly masturbating for eternity can a creature like that really still be considered human no caroline realizes so she summons prime intellect and announces to it that she no longer considers herself to be a human being in fact she argues prime intellect has destroyed the very species it was programmed to serve lawrence tries to stop her but in the end even he can't deny the truth he joins caroline in renouncing his humanity and orders prime intellect to stimulate the pleasure centers of his brain for eternity forced into a first law conflict with no resolution prime intellect experiences a catastrophic system crash the environment around caroline and lawrence disappears then their bodies dissolve and then even their minds come apart as cyberspace implodes in on itself [Music] caroline wakes up naked in the overgrown ruins of her hospital room her body is that of a youthful 16 year old the wilds around her are full of sights sounds and smells that are not common to the simulated environments of cyberspace she walks a short distance and comes across lawrence also inhabiting a mortal adolescent body in the crumbling remains of the chiptech campus they quickly put two and two together whatever they did reversed the change and they are somehow the only two humans to have survived the cataclysm once the shock wears off caroline and lawrence set about providing themselves with food water and shelter homesick caroline proposes that they journey to arkansas her first birthplace to start a new life it takes them four years to reach their destination keeping themselves alive by hunting and gathering with tools that would not have been out of place in the paleolithic along the way caroline gives birth to their first two children a daughter who they call nugget and a son named ozark when nugget and ozark reach puberty they have ritual sex with each other and their parents the humans need to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible to maximize their chances of the continuation of their species forty years later the family now a small tribe of people living atop a misty mountain ridge burns lawrence's body in an enormous funeral pyre the humans have developed a primitive culture characterized by incestuous fertility magic ritualistic tattooing and mild veneration for father lawrence and mother caroline as the keepers of mysterious ancient knowledge thirty years after that caroline and nugget are both old women caroline has sensed that her death is imminent and has decided to travel to some nearby hot springs to die bathed in the steaming waters caroline tells nugget the story of prime intellect for their very first time and swears her to secrecy her mind races with questions about the meaning of her long life and the uncertain future of her tribe right up until the moment her head slips beneath the water and she is finally able to die there are two ways to interpret the end of the metamorphosis as a prime intellect the most obvious of course is that this is a thing that really happened the entire universe got burned there's nothing left with these people on this primitive world who are about to learn what inbreeding means and the other is that the whole of chapter eight is a gigantic put on job that this is prime intellect's ham handed way of doing psychotherapy and trying to put lawrence and carolyn in a place where they can adjust and come to understand the benefits of the place that they were before and maybe return to cyberspace with a little better understanding of the advantages and so forth and i found that among the many many people who contacted me about it that the split between those ideas was almost exactly 50 50. and when you told a person who was in one camp about the other they were always like what they had never heard it was like that never considered that really [Music] i'm speeding the metamorphosis of prime intellect is a bit of a seminal text among singularity bros those who eagerly await the aforementioned rapture of the nerds it's a common topic of discussion over at our singularity but you do see one common critique that tends to pop up over and over i love the book up until the end i'm not sure everyone praising this book actually finished it because it's some hard luddite nonsense at the end please no no more hot takes from prime intellect fans it's one of the very few credible post singularity utopias in fiction actually worth inhabiting and the author gets a lot of credit for actually attempting to work out the day-to-day mechanics it's not actually credible especially with the mysticism at the end i gotta disagree the ending is my favorite part of the book as well as the part that creeped me out the most i got through all the american psycho [ __ ] no problem but around the time of the graphic father-daughter incest scene my skin really started to crawl and it's been a while since a piece of fiction shocked me like that or even really surprised me and this fits in with the biblical theme too right if cyberspace is a hard sci-fi sequel to revelations then this ending is a rosencrantz and guildenstern or dead type side story filling in the plot holes in genesis and of course in chapter three the serpent tempts eve into eating of the fruit of the knowledge of the you know yadda yadda we all know this story and then god gets super pissed and he kicks adam and eve out of the garden of eden and of course then makes them mortal and actually in cyberspace caroline's virtual body is covered in tattoos of snakes which i think is a nice little detail and then in chapter four eve gives birth to cain and abel kane kills abel and flees to the land of nod and then before we know it he's banging some chick the text just says his wife and having a bunch of babies with her so where did this woman come from i mean logically it's got to be some unnamed sister or niece right but the text does kind of squirt around that little bit it doesn't say he went to nod with his wife it says he went to nod and had sex with somebody right it seems to imply that the lady was there so where did she come from is she some long-lost sister of of cain and abel i mean it's it my point is that it's that the bible believe it or not can be a little bit inconsistent and again this is part of what makes the metamorphosis of prime intellect so great it takes these vague mythic concepts and plays them out in a realistic and plausible way the result is often incredibly horrifying roger is fascinated by the intersection of mysticism and technology and that's clearly where he loses some of the singularity bros but i think there's a deeper reason why some people are put off by this ending and that really comes down to what this story is trying to say about the arc of history in the moments after the fall lawrence has a bit of a mental breakdown as well he might he blames himself for this whole mess but caroline reassures him saying you didn't create prime intellect alone do you think you'll be building any self-aware computers here you had a lot of encouragement and a lot of help and all you did was provide what everyone thought they wanted if it hadn't been prime intellect then it would have been something else maybe hundreds or thousands of years later but it's all the the singularity and humanity's hellish fate of turning into masturbating neurons for eternity is portrayed as inevitable what a horrible notion so this is i think like a pretty hopeless book [Laughter] like quite quite crushingly so in certain in certain ways that's one interpretation primitivity is the only solution the text offers but even then kind of but not really i think the charge that this is a luddite book is deeply unfair because as caroline lies dying she knows that eventually members of her family are gonna start killing one another and splitting off into different tribes and inventing agriculture and building empires and starting podcasts and eventually building a supercomputer that achieves singularity rewrites the software of the universe and becomes god it's going to be an endless loop revelation ends and genesis begins over and over and over and over again and there's no escape no salvation just the blunt force of mindless determinism we're all hurtling toward a black hole and there is absolutely nothing that any of us can do to stop it that is unless rogers plans for a sequel pan out uh you know it took me 12 years to write the first one and uh we are now getting close to 20 since i promised this one but i'm not going to rush it because uh you know the the muse works on its own time and it may be the intention that i won't finish it the one thing that is definite because of it though is the that it is canon as far as i'm concerned that it is a put on job but she will not simply just wake up in cyberspace it won't be that simple uh prime analytic does not quite finish doing its ham-handed version of psychotherapy maybe in the follow-up roger will offer us a glimmer of hope about humanity's future but knowing him probably not the sense that that i got was that that the world of the story does not hold humanity in particularly high regard yes it it it doesn't hold humanity in high regard is there anything else [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
